# Virus

Virus is an open-source system optimization tool designed to remove bloatware, restrict telemetry, and give you full control over your operating system. Unlike traditional antivirus software, Virus doesn't run in the background or slow down your systemâ€”it only runs when you tell it to, removing the real threats: spyware, forced updates, and unnecessary features.
âš¡ Features

    ðŸ”’ Privacy First â€“ Disable telemetry, tracking, and invasive system features.
    ðŸ›  System Customization â€“ Remove Cortana, Edge, Siri, and other locked-down features.
    ðŸ’¾ Protocol & Filesystem Tweaks â€“ Remove SMB, add NFS, enable EXT4 support on Windows.
    ðŸ¦  Manual Antivirus â€“ No bloat, no background scansâ€”just run Virus when you want to check for threats.
