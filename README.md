# Virus

Virus is an open-source system optimization tool designed to remove bloatware, restrict telemetry, and give you more control Windows 11.

Unlike traditional antivirus software, Virus doesn't run in the background or slow down your systemâ€”it only runs when you tell it to, removing the real threats: spyware, forced updates, and attack surfaces.

âš¡ Features:
ðŸš€ Remove Bloatware â€“ Get rid of unnecessary apps and services.
ðŸ”’ Privacy First â€“ Disable telemetry, tracking, and invasive system features.
ðŸ›  System Customization â€“ Remove Cortana, Edge, CoPilot, and other proprietary malware.

## Installation
See [Releases](https://github.com/ravendevteam/talon/releases). Download the latest version for Windows.

To compile from source, make sure you have Python 3.12.4 or greater, and Nuitka, then run `build.bat`.
